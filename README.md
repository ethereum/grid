# Info

This is the hosting application for [Mist UI](https://github.com/ethereum/mist-ui) and can be considered a [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/Mist) alternative.
This project ensures that the user can update, configure and run the Mist UI web app and client binaries such as geth.
Moreover this project can be bundled with Mist UI and create distributable installers that can be found under 'releases'.

### Quick Start

First we need to install less and Mist UI:

```
npm install -g less
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/mist-ui.git
cd mist-ui
yarn && yarn run watch-css
```

In another terminal, go to the mist-ui folder, type:

```
yarn run start
```

Then in a third terminal, outside the mist-ui folder and install and run mist-shell:

```
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/mist-shell.git
cd mist-shell
yarn && yarn start:dev
```

## Dev Mode

The developer mode will try to load Mist UI from a locally running web server on port `3080`. To run in dev mode you will have to follow the setup instructions on the Mist UI repo.

### Debugging

Enable debug logging to console with `DEBUG=geth-js yarn start:dev`.

More namespaces will be added over time and listed here. We would appreciate contributions in adding more throughout our modules.

## Production Mode

In the the production mode a bundled app can be loaded from either `fs` or a remote location such as Mist UI's GitHub releases.
