# Enter the Grid

This is the hosting application for [Grid UI](https://github.com/ethereum/grid-ui) and can be considered a [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/Mist) alternative in the long run.
This project ensures that the user can update, configure and run the Grid UI web app and client binaries such as geth.
Moreover this project can be bundled with Grid UI and create distributable installers that can be found under 'releases'.

### Quick Start

First we need to install less and Grid UI:

```
npm install -g less
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/grid-ui.git
cd grid-ui
yarn && yarn run watch-css
```

In another terminal, go to the grid-ui folder, type:

```
yarn run start
```

Then in a third terminal, outside the grid-ui folder and install and run grid:

```
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/grid.git
cd grid
yarn && yarn start:dev
```

## Dev Mode

The developer mode will try to load grid UI from a locally running web server on port `3080`. To run in dev mode you will have to follow the setup instructions on the Grid UI repo.

### Debugging

Enable debug logging to console with `DEBUG=geth-js yarn start:dev`.

More namespaces will be added over time and listed here. We would appreciate contributions in adding more throughout our modules.

## Production Mode

In the the production mode a bundled app can be loaded from either `fs` or a remote location such as Grid UI's GitHub releases.

# Release Process
