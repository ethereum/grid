See this [introductory post](https://medium.com/ethereum-grid/introducing-ethereum-grid-1e65e7fb771e) to learn more about the motivations behind the project. Release announcements and tutorials are released on the project [Medium publication](https://medium.com/ethereum-grid).

## Development

This repo is the hosting application for [Grid UI](https://github.com/ethereum/grid-ui).

### Quick Start

Install and run Grid UI:

```
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/grid-ui.git
cd grid-ui
yarn && yarn start
```

Install and run Grid:

```
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/grid.git
cd grid
yarn && yarn start:dev
```

### Dev Mode

`yarn start:dev`

The developer mode will try to load grid UI from a locally running web server on port `3080`.

#### Debugging

Enable debug logging to console with `DEBUG=geth-js yarn start:dev`.

More namespaces will be added over time and listed here. We would appreciate contributions in adding more throughout our modules.

### Production Mode

`yarn start:prod`

In production mode, a bundled app can be loaded from either `fs` or a remote location such as Grid UI's GitHub releases.
